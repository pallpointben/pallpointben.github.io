			My name is Ben Pall. I am a Tufts student from New Jersey majoring in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science. Born in 1995, I have always been interested in puzzles and problem solving. I have been making puzzles since I was 12. On November 23, 2009, at age 14, my first crossword puzzle was published in the New York Times.

			My goal to contribute to the movement to make technology easier and more fun for everyone. I chose my majors to build a skill set that will help me accomplish my goal.
