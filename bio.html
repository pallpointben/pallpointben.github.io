			<p> My name is Ben Pall. I am a Tufts student from New Jersey majoring in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science. I am an aspiring UX designer, web developer, and game designer. </p>

			<p> Born in 1995, I have always been interested in puzzles and problem solving. I have been making puzzles since I was 12. On November 23, 2009, at age 14, my first crossword puzzle was published in the New York Times. My sense of curiosity didn't stop there. I took my first computer science class in college in the spring of 2014 and instantly fell in love with the power of code.</p>

			<p> Today, my goal to contribute to the movement to make technology easier and more fun for everyone. I chose my majors to build a skill set that will help me accomplish my goal. </p>
